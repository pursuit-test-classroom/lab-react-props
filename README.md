- [MY LIVE SITE URL]()

## Instructions

Inside of the `App.js` file are two variables which will serve as props for your application:

1. `targetAmount`: A number, in dollars, that represents the total amount of money attempting to be raised.

1. `donations`: An array of objects, where each object represents a donation.

Create each component in the `Components/` directory and pass props from the `App` component to each of the components to create the mockup as seen above. HTML snippets for each component is included below.

### Components

Each of the components below must be completed and must make use of props. A "hardcoded" HTML snippet is included below so that you can focus on passing props as opposed to creating HTML. _Do not_ just copy and paste the HTML into the component and update the text. While this may pass the tests, it does not demonstrate you know anything about props.

#### DonationForm

For the donation form, you will need to update the sentence "You could be donation #1!" so that instead of being hardcoded to the number `1`, it is set to a number one above the actual number of donations.

```html
<section className="donation">
  <h3>You could be donation <span class="secondary">#1!</span></h3>
  <form>
    <label htmlFor="name"
      >Name<input
        id="name"
        name="name"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Your name..." /></label
    ><label htmlFor="caption"
      >Caption<input
        id="caption"
        name="caption"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Add a brief message..." /></label
    ><label htmlFor="amount"
      >Amount<input
        id="amount"
        name="amount"
        type="number"
        placeholder="0" /></label
    ><button>Donate!</button>
  </form>
</section>
```

### Progress

For the progress section, you will need to replace the value `$0` with a dynamic value based on the donations.

```html
<section className="progress">
  <h2>
    Raised <span className="secondary">$0</span> of
    <span className="secondary">$1000</span>
  </h2>
</section>
```

### Recent Donations

For the recent donations section, you will need to have a number of `li` elements equal to the number of donations. Each `li` should include the person who donated, the amount, and their caption.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Recent Donations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Jo donated $25</span>You really need this. Really.</li>
    <li><span>Rami donated $10</span>Here, take a break from work!</li>
    <!-- etc... -->
  </ul>
</section>
```
